                types.Part.from_text(text="""**Pinpointing Core Functionality**

I've been drilling down on the original request: a functional \"PDF to Word Converter.\" The initial focus landed on the `convertToWord` function - essentially, a placeholder for the real conversion process. Now, I'm analyzing the structure of the existing code, identifying the critical areas for improvement and considering the necessary external libraries and APIs required.


**Addressing Backend Needs**

The HTML structure for a PDF-to-Word converter is in place. Recognizing the impossibility of client-side conversion, I'm focusing on highlighting the limitations of the current placeholder and setting expectations accordingly. This will involve incorporating clear instructions and feedback for users on the limitations of browser-based file conversion.


**Refining the Approach**

I'm now fully immersed in the limitations of client-side PDF-to-Word conversion. The goal is no longer a functional conversion, but a framework to communicate and improve the current HTML/JS. I'm focusing on the user interface and how to provide clearer feedback about backend dependencies.


**Enhancing User Guidance**

I'm now integrating detailed comments into the JavaScript code to clearly outline the limitations of client-side PDF-to-Word conversion and provide a roadmap for users on the correct path to a working backend. This improvement goes beyond basic error handling and is aimed at managing user expectations.

**Expanding the Scope**

I've been exploring a more robust client-side approach, considering text extraction and the limitations. While conversion is impossible, focusing on user feedback and accessibility is vital. Adding a file type check, button disabling, and clarifying the download process are my main areas of focus. I'm aiming for an enhanced, more informative mock that clearly articulates the backend dependencies.


**Clarifying Limitations and Expectations**

I've been immersed in the limitations of client-side PDF-to-Word conversion, focusing on the essential task of communicating the impossibility of direct conversion within a browser. I'm prioritizing the user experience, now emphasizing clear feedback and instructions. The goal is to set realistic expectations and offer guidance regarding backend dependencies.


**Developing a Robust Framework**

I've been fully immersed in building a robust framework. I'm prioritizing clear communication about the impossibility of client-side PDF-to-Word conversion, focusing on user feedback and accessibility, with the core goal of developing a more effective mock with added explanations and guidance, emphasizing the vital connection with necessary backend dependencies.


"""),
                types.Part.from_text(text="""This is a good-looking HTML structure and a functional mock-up for a PDF to Word converter!

Here's a breakdown of what's good and what the \"placeholder\" comment correctly identifies:

**What's Good:**

1.  **Clear UI:** The interface is simple, clean, and intuitive.
2.  **Responsive Design:** The `@media` query makes it adapt reasonably to smaller screens.
3.  **User Feedback:** The `status` paragraph provides feedback to the user, which is essential.
4.  **File Type Filter:** `accept=\"application/pdf\"` in the file input is a good first step to guide users to select the correct file type (though client-side validation should also be done).
5.  **Mock Download:** The `setTimeout` and `Blob` creation effectively simulate the download process for demonstration purposes.

**The \"Placeholder\" - The Core Challenge:**

As your comment `// Placeholder: Actual conversion requires backend or external API` rightly points out, **client-side JavaScript running in a browser cannot directly convert a PDF file into a DOCX (Word) file.**

*   **PDF Complexity:** PDFs are complex, vector-based (often) documents that can contain text, images, fonts, layouts, and more.
*   **DOCX Complexity:** DOCX is also a complex, proprietary format (Office Open XML).
*   **Browser Limitations:** Browsers are sandboxed environments. They don't have the low-level file system access or the powerful libraries needed for such a conversion. Libraries that perform this kind of heavy lifting are typically written in languages like C++, Java, Python, or C# and run on a server.

**How a Real Conversion Would Work:**

1.  **File Upload to Server:** The user selects a PDF. The JavaScript would use `FormData` and `fetch` (or `XMLHttpRequest`) to send this file to a backend server.
2.  **Server-Side Processing:**
    *   The server (e.g., written in Node.js, Python/Flask, Java/Spring, PHP/Laravel) receives the PDF file.
    *   It uses a specialized library or tool to perform the conversion:
        *   **Open Source Libraries:** `pdf2docx` (Python), Apache PDFBox + Apache POI (Java), various Node.js wrappers around command-line tools.
        *   **Commercial SDKs:** Aspose.Words, GroupDocs.Conversion, Adobe PDF Services API, Cloudmersive API, etc. These often provide higher fidelity conversions.
        *   **Command-Line Tools:** `libreoffice --headless --convert-to docx`, `pandoc` (though Pandoc's PDF to DOCX can be lossy for complex layouts).
3.  **Sending Converted File Back:** Once converted, the server sends the resulting DOCX file back to the client as a file download response.
4.  **Client-Side Download:** The JavaScript receives this file and triggers a download, much like your mock-up does with `URL.createObjectURL` and an `<a>` tag.

**Improvements to Your Existing Mock-up (while keeping it client-side mock):**

Even as a mock-up, we can make a few small enhancements:

1.  **Disable Button During \"Processing\":** Prevent multiple clicks.
2.  **Clearer Status Updates:** More distinct messages.
3.  **Slightly More Realistic Filename:** Use the original PDF name for the converted DOCX.
4.  **Error Handling for File Selection:** A more specific message if a non-PDF is selected (though `accept` attribute helps, JS can reinforce this).
5.  **Accessibility:** Add a `label` for the file input.

Here's the refined HTML/JS:

```html

if __name__ == "__main__":
    generate()
